6/12 of us have arrived

# Independent Project
**TODO** merge this information into Independent Project folder
Slides are on Moodle but we don't have accounts lmao

- M23441 is for BEng students
- M22662 is for MEng students

Individual project must be done by ourselves, obviously. Project supervisor can only guide us in the right direction

5 soft skills we need to learn:
1. Critical thinking
2. Problem solving
3. Team work (go to the workshop and talk to people)
4. Time management
5. Good communication skills

Independent project is 40 credits out of 120

3 categories of student:
1. Has an idea
2. ???

Moodle is accessible via port.ac.uk

10th of October is when the project database (staff ideas we can use) is closed, **do not miss this**. My proposal must be submitted by then.

Independent project final report submission is ..... Ah fuck he scrolled away

Uni provides Â£100 budget for hardware/material.

Buy things ahead of time, it's been known for things to take up to 2 months to arrive. They have workshops which can be booked for mechanical/electrical work, 3d printers, etc

There is a report template we can follow. We either produce a report or dissertation(?) Essential Information section on Moodle lists important dates.

Once I come up with an idea, I must submit a proposal to the Uni.

2 supervisors: academic supervisor from Uni, job mentor from work

~~Uni supervisor is allocated once I submit the proposal. I should request a person who has relevant experience. Write the code for some project in the project selection form. Do not paste the title lol~~

~~There must be a supervisor for a project to be approved. If there's nobody willing to supervise the project, fill my user id in the PROJECT SELECTION form reference fields~~

Instructions are written on Moodle, which is good because this guy is saying things in a fucking confusing way

"Database" actually means a spreadsheet lol

~~12/16 projects are compulsory but cannot select more than 3 from the same uni supervisor (does this apply to us since we can't use staff-defined projects? Probably not)~~

Degree Apprentices (us) cannot select from the staff-defined list, so ignore most of what I just wrote. That stuff only applies to regular students. We must come up with an idea ourselves.

Some projects need an Ethics certification. Issued by Faculty Ethics Committee.

Final submission can contain addendums: proposal, ethics, and another one

Pass mark is 40% like UWTSD, but IET says each assessment artifact (exam/coursework) must be both at least 30%. For instance, if you get 0% on an exam but 100% on coursework, you will fail despite having 50% overall because the exam didn't reach 30%.

If you're not able to attend, email line manager and teacher, ideally well in advance.
