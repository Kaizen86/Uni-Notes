Writing this on my phone because my laptop ran out of battery >:(
Hopefully John doesn't think ill of me...

Types of Filters:
- RC Circuit
- Low Pass, High Pass, Band Pass, Band Stop
- Butterworth Filter Response
- LC Ladder Filters
- Active Filters
	- Using active components such as Op Amps or transistors
- Analogue Impulse Response
	- $h(t)$
- Transfer Function
	- $H(\omega), H(f), H(j\omega), H(s)$
	- Where $\omega, f, j\omega$ are analogue frequencies, and $s$ is the Laplace ...

$$
\begin{align}
	&H(j\omega) = \frac{1}{1+j\omega RC} \\
	&\text{Substitute in } X_c = \frac{1}{j\omega c} \\
	V_{out} = V_{in} \\
	\frac{\frac{1}{j\omega c}}{R + \frac{1}{j\omega c}} = V_{in} \cdots \\
	TODO
\end{align}
