# Kaizen's Uni Notes
These are my Obsidian notes for my BEng university course. I've made these public in case another student finds them useful. We are learning about Digital Signal Processing and Field Programmable Gate Arrays in the first TB (2025-2026), then Embedded Operating Systems and Advanced Electronic Systems in the second TB (2026). (TB stands for Teaching Block, not [Tuberculosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis))

**These notes are provided as-is**, meaning they are quite informal and sometimes unedited. If the lecturer is going quickly and I can't quite keep up, or if I'm baffled by something, there might be some cathartic profanity. You have been warned lol

# I recommend reading in Obsidian!
Because the notes are intended to be viewed in Obsidian, some features and text formatting do not appear properly when opened in Github. Single line breaks are ignored, multi-line LaTeX equations often appear as arcane incantations, and page links are entirely broken.

If at all possible, you should open these notes in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and use Reading View for the best experience.
## Setup
I strongly suggest using [Git](https://git-scm.com/install) to clone this repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Kaizen86/Uni-Notes
```
I am frequently updating these notes, so this will let you run "Git: Pull" from Obsidian's Command Palette to easily get the latest version. You can also download [just the notes](https://github.com/Kaizen86/Uni-Notes/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) directly, but this will break the Git Pull command.


Best of luck with your exams!
