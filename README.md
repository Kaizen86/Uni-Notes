# Dan's Uni Notes
These are my Obsidian notes for my BEng university course. I've made these public in case another student finds them useful. We are learning about Digital Signal Processing and Field Programmable Gate Arrays in the first Teaching Block (2025-2026), then Embedded Operating Systems and another one I can't remember in the second TB (2026). (TB does not stand for [Tuberculosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis))

**These notes are provided as-is**, meaning they are unedited and quite informal. If the lecturer is going quickly and I can't quite keep up, or if I'm baffled by something, there might be some cathartic profanity. You have been warned lol

## Note about reading them online
Because the notes are intended to be viewed in Obsidian, some features and text formatting do not appear properly when opened in Github. Line breaks are ignored, multi-line LaTeX equations often appear as arcane incantations, and page links don't work at all. If possible, you should [download these notes](https://github.com/Kaizen86/Uni-Notes/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and open them in Obsidian for the best experience.
