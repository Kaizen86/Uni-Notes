If we find our names assigned to 2 projects, let Mojtaba know (does this apply to Degree Apprentices?)

# Project Time Management
Task: Must draw a Gantt chart to plan when I'll work on the project and how long it will take, then stick to it. Include wiggle room to account for things going wrong and other responsibilities.

- Collect data/information
- Analyse/interpret results
- Report on findings
	- Write as you go along to capture everything
	- Send chapters to supervisor incrementally for feedback

At least 2 times a month, talk with supervisor to discuss progress. Does not have to be in person. Report progress and ask for help if stuck, but they can't directly solve problems for us. They can only advise us.
Summarise project progress on Project Monitoring form on Moodle every 2 months!

# Research / Literature Review
Look into which components to buy, has the idea been done before, etc
For all research we read, record paper name, author name, address
Be careful to not claim I've come up with a new idea if someone else thought of it already. There are very few new ideas.
