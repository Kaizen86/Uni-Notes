There are some [helpful calculators](https://chivertj.github.io/dspworksheets) made by the lecturer so we can check our workings

# Linear Time Invariant (LTI) (causal) Systems
Now what the hell do all those words mean?
- Linear: straight line
	- Example of a linear equation is $y = mx+c$
- Invariant: Does not change with respect to something
	- In this case it does not change with respect to linear and time
	- But mostly it's about the 'time' part
- Time invariant: Does not change or vary with respect to time
- Causal: Does not depend on the future inputs
	- Not to be confused with "Casual". ***Looking at you, Martin***

input (time-based $x[n]$) $\rightarrow$ LTI System (digital) $\rightarrow$ output ($y[n]$)
	Where n indicates discrete time samples (whole numbers: 0,1,2,...)

## Examples of LTI Systems
1. Filters
	- Low Pass
	- Band Pass
	- High Pass
	- ![[Filter types.png]]
	- An ideal filter would have completely vertical edges (where the transition band has no width), but that never happens in real life. The picture shows non-ideal realistic filters.

## Mathematical definition of an LTI
For a linear system $y[n] = F(x[n])$
$$f(ax_1[n]+bx_2[n]) = aF(x_1[n])+bF(x_2[n])$$
## Properties of LTI Systems
$x_1[n]$ and $x_2[n] \rightarrow$ LTI System ($h[n]$) $\rightarrow y[n]$
x and y could be multiplied separately, producing e.g. by $ax_1[n]$, then the two products can be added, e.g. $ax_1[n]+bx_2[n]$, then fed into an LTI System $g[n]$ to result in $y[n]$.

Here's the kicker: for an LTI System we can place the LTI System before the multiplication & sum to get an equivalent result.
	$x_1[n] \rightarrow$ LTI System $g[n] \rightarrow$ multiply by $xa$
	$x_2[n] \rightarrow$ LTI System $g[n]\rightarrow$ multiply by $xb$
	Then add products of $xa$ and $xb$ to create $y[n]$
$g[n]$ is called an [[Impulse Response]]!
